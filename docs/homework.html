<h3>Lab 1</h3>
<p><strong>It’ll be barely visible at first: a twitch.</strong> A white
mouse will be laid on its back on your desk, pinned to a wax tray, its
organs exposed.Itself freshly dead, the mouse’s schistosome parasites
will still be alive. Just within the hepatic portal vein and visible
across the thin wall of the vessel, paired male and female worms will
thrash, sensing their host’s demise.When I see this, I’m always
awestruck at the devastation wreaked on the liver by wayward
<em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> eggs, at the organ’s distention, its mounds
of granulomas. I’m also awestruck at the thought that such eggs are – at
this very moment – navigating the same winding route through human
bodies, causing the same pathology.</p>

<p>This year, I’ll kick off our labs by throwing you into the deep end
of the parasitology pool. In our first lab, you will get to see
<strong>live schistosome adults in mice and hatch their eggs into

<h4>Phylum Platyhelminthes</h4>
<p>The platyhelminths are commonly referred to as “flatworms”, since
they are typically dorsoventrally flattened. This large and diverse
phylum is comprised of four major classes (Turbellaria, Trematoda,
Monogenea, and Cestoidea) that we will study in more depth throughout
the next few labs. The hypothetical relationships of these major groups
are shown in the cladogram below, which traces the common ancestry among
the groups. The platyhelminths as a group provide an exciting
introduction to parasitology because one can trace the evolution and
specialization for parasitism throughout the group. While studying the
flatworms, pay particular attention to the reproductive anatomy,
reproductive capacity, adaptations for a parasitic life style, and
transmission stages.</p>

<div id="the-trematode-life-cycle" class="section level4">
<h4>The trematode life cycle</h4>
<p>The digenetic trematodes comprise a truly marvelous array of
families, genera, and species. Classification of the Digenea is
determined on the basis of the size, shape, and placement of suckers,
arrangement of flame cells, and especially on details of the
reproductive system. The Digenea are one of the largest platyhelminth
groups, with an estimated 40,000 described species in at least 125
families. Taxonomy in this large group is still in a dynamic state.</p>
<p>The majority of the Digenea are equipped with two muscular suckers.
The largest of these, the acetabulum (ventral sucker), is located on the
ventral surface of the worm and serves as an attachment structure. The
oral sucker surrounds the mouth and is located at the anterior end of
the worm. Most digenes are less than 30 mm in length and many species
are less than 3 mm. On the other hand, Hirudinella, a species found in
the stomach of some marine fish species, may attain the length and girth
of a summer squash. Here’s a video of an adult Hirudinella marina, which
Chelsea dissected from the stomach of a pelagic wahoo (please forgive
the way the camera moves and the noise in the background - this video
was taken on a sailing research vessel on the high seas!):</p>

<p>The ordinal name, Digenea, refers to the fact that the life cycle of
these flatworms involves an alternation of hosts, with asexual
reproduction occurring in intermediate hosts. As many as three
intermediate hosts and a single definitive host may be required to
complete a digenetic trematode life cycle. The first intermediate host
is typically a gastropod (snail). The definitive host is always a
vertebrate. Asexual reproduction in parasites may occur in intermediate
hosts; sexual reproduction (cross-fertilization of the hermaphroditic
worms) occurs only in the definitive host.</p>
<p>Adult digenetic trematodes (known as “flukes” in the common
vernacular) are typically found in the digestive tract and associated
viscera of definitive hosts but may be found in almost any organ or
tissue. The vertebrate definitive hosts typically have high vagility
(i.e., they move across long distances), which facilitates the
distribution of parasite eggs. All vertebrate classes serve as hosts to
these parasites. Digenetic trematodes are economically and medically
significant, as some species cause serious pathology in domestic animals
and humans.</p>
<p>The digenetic trematodes have some of the most complicated life
histories in the animal kingdom. Digenetic trematode life cycles are
“indirect” or “complex”, meaning that more than one host species is
required to complete the life cycle. All species have asexually and
sexually reproducing life states and a minimum of two hosts: a
<strong>first intermediate host</strong> and a <strong>definitive
host</strong>. Many taxa incorporate a second or third intermediate host
as well. Although this may, at first, seem confusing, there are really
two basic variations to the theme as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Taxa that have an intermediate host (usually a snail) and a
definitive host (vertebrate) only.</li>
<li>Taxa that incorporate additional intermediate hosts (which may be
mollusks, annelids, arthropods, or vertebrates) between the first
intermediate and definitive hosts.</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/trematode_lc.png">
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Asexual reproduction occurs in the intermediate host. Sexual
reproduction, resulting in the production of eggs, occurs only in the
definitive host. There are three distinct larval stages involved in all
digenetic trematode life cycles: the <strong>miracidium</strong>,
<strong>sporocyst</strong>, and <strong>cercaria</strong>. Some taxa
also produce <strong>rediae</strong> and/or encysted
<strong>metacercariae</strong>. All of these life stages except for the
miracidium can be found in first intermediate hosts. One of the many
interesting aspects of digenetic trematode parasite life cycles is the
parasitic castration of the first intermediate host. Parasitic
castration is the elimination of reproductive capability in the host,
and results from consumption of and interference with the gonad tissue
by larval digenetic trematode parasites. The castrated host continues to
live and compete with uninfected individuals in the host population, but
only produces larval parasites.</p>
<p><strong>Miracidium:</strong> The miracidium is the larval stage that
develops within the egg produced by the adult fluke in the definitive
host. After hatching from the egg, miracidia are infective to the first
intermediate host. The miracidium is a minute, ovoid, aquatic, motile
stage covered with cilia. These cilia are shed when infection is
initiated by penetration of the host or consumption of embyronated eggs
by an appropriate host. In the video below, you will see a miracidium
(of the trematode species Fasciola hepatica) hatching out of its egg,
using its cilia to swim away, and leaving behind an empty eggshell:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/78u7YKKPEKY"
class="uri">https://youtu.be/78u7YKKPEKY</a></p>
<p><strong>Sporocyst:</strong> Infection of the first intermediate hosts
begins when the miracidium enters that host and becomes a primary or
“mother” sporocyst. The primary sporocyst gives rise to a second
generation asexually; the second generation may be daughter sporocysts
or rediae. Embryos within the daughter sporocysts may produce another
generation of sporocysts, rediae, or cercariae. Sporocysts are
“sack-like” organisms with no mouth or digestive system. The sporocyst
absorbs nutrients directly from host tissue to supply the developing
larvae.</p>
<p><strong>Rediae:</strong> SOME groups of digeneans produce rediae.
Rediae have a rudimentary digestive system consisting of a mouth,
muscular pharynx, and short, unbranched gut; this larval stage may be
distinguished from a sporocyst based on the presence of these
structures. Rediae can be quite active and even downright aggressive,
feeding actively on host tissue and sometimes upon other larval
trematodes within the host. Note that not all digenean trematodes
possess a redia stage – some only produce sporocysts.</p>
<p><strong>Cercariae:</strong> Cercariae are asexually produced by
sporocysts or rediae, depending on the species of trematode. Cercariae
are free-swimming, sperm-like creatures that encyst in or penetrate the
next host. Three different scenarios are possible:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Penetration of a second intermediate host and development of an
encysted stage (metacercaria) in that host.</li>
<li>Penetration of the definitive (vertebrate) host and development of
the adult fluke in that host.</li>
<li>Encysting on a suitable substrate in the environment or on the
outside of an intermediate host.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the video below, you can see cercariae spilling out of burst
sporocysts dissected from a snail intermediate host (note that you can
see the ventral suckers clear as day on each cercaria!):</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/d3wced1DQd4"
class="uri">https://youtu.be/d3wced1DQd4</a></p>
<p><strong>Metacercariae:</strong> The metacercaria is an encysted
larval stage that occurs in many digenean life cycles. Metacercariae are
infective to the definitive host in the life cycle. Infection of the
definitive host by a metacercaria is always trophic: the definitive host
consumes the metacercariae in an infected intermediate host or on food
items. Metacercaria can develop in both invertebrate and vertebrate
hosts and on invertebrates. The developing fluke may be visible inside
of the cyst (as in the illustration below):</p>

Oatmeal</em> is here to help! <a

</div>
<div id="order-strigeiformes" class="section level4">
<h4>Order Strigeiformes</h4>
<p>The Order Strigeiformes is pretty unique among the trematodes:
instead of a three-host life cycle, the Srigeiformes use only two hosts
(a first intermediate snail and a vertebrate definitive host). The Order
Srigeiformes includes those digene species whose cercariae have forked
tails. The cercariae also possess specialized glands for penetration of
the hosts. The digenetic trematodes in the Superfamily Schistosomatoidea
are usually <strong>dioecious</strong>, having separate male and female
worms. The schistosomes are our representative material for this order,
but they are <strong>unusual in many ways and highly adapted for
parasitism</strong>. Adult worms live permanently in copula within the
host.</p>

<p>Schistosomes are long, thin worms, an adaptation to living in the
small blood vessels of the mammalian hepatic portal system. The
<strong>oral sucker</strong> and <strong>acetabulum</strong> are
adjacent in these worms. The male is recognized by the presence of the
<strong>gynecophoric canal</strong>, a deep groove on the ventral
surface that holds the female worm. The testis is also usually visible
in stained specimens. The <strong>genital pore</strong> is just
posterior to the acetabulum in the female worm. Lateral
<strong>vitellaria</strong> occupy the posterior half of the body and
the compact ovary is previtelline. The digestive <strong>caecae</strong>
are usually visible as dark coiled tubes. What are these worms
eating?</p>

<p>Schistosome cercariae are fork-tailed. Once released from their snail
hosts, they swim through the water column, seeking out a vertebrate
definitive host. In the case of <em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> and
<em>Schistosoma haematobium</em>, the definitive hosts are human, and
they infect human hosts by penetrating the skin of people bathing in
streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds containing snails. In lab, you will
see only the adult and egg stages of this parasite, not the cercariae
(even though the Wood Lab does keep living schistosome cercariae in its
biosafety-level 2 facility). Why am I not giving you schistosome
cercariae to handle?</p>

<h5><em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> adults in the vertebrate definitive
host</h5>
<p>Schistosomiasis (human infection with schistosome worms) is a
debilitating disease, rarely killing but often disabling infected
individuals. Today we will see the destructiveness of schistosomes
firsthand. The US National Institutes of Health maintains the life cycle
of <em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> in their laboratories near Washington,
DC, using <em>Biomphalaria glabrata</em> snails as intermediate hosts
and laboratory mice as definitive hosts. They provide infected mice to
research and teaching laboratories around the country. We have access to
these infected animals for our teaching laboratory. These mice gave
their lives for science, so please treat them with respect.</p>
<p>Mice are great models for human schistosomiasis. Much of the
schistosome-related pathology suffered by the mice is closely mirrored
in human (and other vertebrate) patients. Five weeks ago, the mice you
see before you were exposed to water with active <em>Schistosoma
mansoni</em> cercariae. They were then shipped to UW, and we held them
for six weeks, while their S. mansoni parasites developed. Some of these
mice may be uninfected, but most will carry extremely heavy
infections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Begin by performing an external examination of your mouse. Do you
see anything unusual or notable? Measure your mouse’s length, from snout
to rear and from snout to tail tip.</li>
<li>Lay your mouse on its back and begin by making an incision from the
anus to the throat using the small scissors. Keep your incision shallow
to avoid damaging internal organs.</li>
<li>Pin out the flaps of skin on either side of the mouse, exposing the
body cavity.</li>
<li>Observe and draw the internal organs. Note anything unusual.</li>
<li>Compare the liver and intestines of the infected mouse to pictures
of healthy mice (see below). What pathology do you observe in the
infected mouse? The white spots on the liver of the infected animal are
granulomas. Encapsulation of schistosome eggs by the host causes
granulomas. What is the consequence to the host? How did the eggs get
into the liver? * Where should they be?</li>
<li>Now use your dissecting scope to explore the internal organs more
closely. The adult worms are visible in the portal veins of your
mouse.</li>
<li>Once you have finished drawing your host, remove its parasites.
Tease apart the organs to access the portal veins. * * * Breach the
portal vein to pull out the worm, or pull out the entire vein.</li>
<li>Place adult worms into Ringers’ solution. Can you differentiate
between the male and female worms? Describe any movement or behavior
that you see in these living specimens. Draw both the adults and
eggs.</li>
<li>Many of these worms will have ripe eggs. Any student who is able to
obtain a miracidium will be awarded +3 points on the next exam. Hint:
what kind of fluid will trigger hatching in a schistosome egg?</li>
<li>The prominent lateral spine is diagnostic for this species. The eggs
of Schistosoma japonicum have a less prominent spine and those of
haematobium are terminal. How are spined eggs an adaptation for these
worms? Most helminth parasite infections in humans are diagnosed by the
presence of characteristic eggs in the feces or urine. You should be
able to identify schistosome eggs on the exam.</li>

<h5><em>Cercaria batillariae</em> larvae in the snail intermediate
host</h5>
<p>The Japanese mud snail Batillaria attramentaria is native to Japan
but was introduced to the US west coast in the early 1900s, probably in
shipments of Asian oysters.In California, it has driven out a native mud
snail, <em>Cerithidea californica</em>, in part because Batillaria has
only one parasite (Cercaria batillariae), whereas Cerithidea can have up
to 20! Greg Jensen collected these snails in mid-September from the
intertidal zone in Silverdale, WA.</p>
<p>Please familiarize yourself with gastropod internal anatomy before
you begin the dissection:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/snail_anatomy.jpg"> <em></em>
</p>
<p>Place three snails in a beaker of seawater. Add just enough water to
cover the tops of their shells. Give them a few minutes, then remove the
snails into a watchglass. Check the water for tiny, swimming cercariae
with the naked eye. Place the water from the beaker into a watch glass
and check closely with a stereomicroscope for cercariae.</p>
<p>Place one snail on the benchtop. Take a total length measurement (the
longest dimension of the shell) and record this in your lab notebook.
Crack the spire with a hammer (gently) to reveal the snail. Put the
snail in a watchglass and moisten the animal with seawater. Carefully
remove the shell pieces for better viewing and examine the animal under
a dissecting scope. Infection may or may not be immediately apparent.
The visceral hump (the spiral organ that contains the digestive gland
and gonads) is the narrow, “corkscrew” extremity of the snail. If the
visceral hump is whitish, tan, or mottled, the snail is probably
infected with trematodes. If it is dark green or gold, the snail may be
uninfected.</p>
<p>Examine the gonad for sporocysts and/or rediae. If you don’t see any
at first, tear the tissue with forceps to examine the deeper
tissues.</p>
<p>Draw any cercariae, rediae, or sporcysts that you find and record
your observations. Have your TA check your snail for infection before
you dispose of it! Record your snail data on the board (remember that
zeros are data, too).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you do not succeed in finding an infection
in your snails, please dissect another one or observe another student’s
infected snail.</p>

broader view: we’ll check out a diversity of parasites from marine and
freshwater fishes, covering monogenes, trematodes, cestodes, nematodes,
acanthocephalans, and crustaceans.</p>
<p>When I first started learning about parasites, I thought about them
as “out there” - out in nature, out in the Global South, away from me.I
could not have been more wrong. Parasites are around us, all the time,
hidden just under the surface of everything that is familiar - your
friends, your pets, even your food.</p>
<p>To prove it to you, we’re going to do some grocery store
parasitology.</p>

<h4>Demonstration instructions</h4>
<p>Parasitology is a “blood and guts” subject. Dissection of freshly
killed host organisms provides the best material for examining living
parasites. In this lab, you will be examining and dissecting freshly
collected teleost fishes. Fishes serve as intermediate and/or definitive
hosts for a diversity of parasite taxa. If you are careful and
observant, you may find many parasites in and on your specimens. Take
your time as you examine the fish/host – <strong>it will take some
practice to develop a search image and many of the parasites are
small</strong>! Check out the representative drawings of fish parasite
taxa before you proceed. Internal anatomy is very consistent across the
vertebrates, and fish host many of the same types of parasites that are
found in people (even some that may infect people!).</p>

<h4>Slides to examine</h4>
<p>In this lab and all the labs to follow, there will be slides for you
to examine. <strong>“But why,”</strong> you wonder, <strong>“should I
look at slides when I can just find pictures of these organisms on the
internet?”</strong> I’ll let you in on a parasitology secret:
<strong>photographs do not capture all of the nuance, detail, and beauty
of the parasites.</strong> Photographs are one-dimensional, but
parasites are three-dimensional; that is to say, photographs can only
bring a single plane into focus, but because parasites are 3D, there are
many other planes where interesting stuff is going on. When you focus on
a microscope slide, you can bring the deepest plane into focus, and then
the next deepest, and so on to the shallowest plane, and in that way,
what you see (and what you draw) is better than a photograph.</p>
<p>You are welcome to take photos of what you see in lab if it helps you
learn, understand, and remember. But <strong>I require all students to
<em>draw, draw, draw</em> because it is the best way to truly
<em>see</em> the parasites.</strong> There is something about the act of
your hand making a drawing that lets your eye see more than it otherwise
would. Try it for yourself and you’ll notice things that you’ve never
seen before!</p>

<h3>Lab 3</h3>
<p><strong>I have a confession to make:</strong> of all the parasites,
the cestodes are my favorites. I first fell in love with them when I was
dissecting a pelagic fish aboard a sailing research vessel, and I found
this:</p>
<p>[SEAMANS VIDEO]</p>
<p>What you’re seeing above is a tapeworm larva in the Order
Trypanorhyncha. These guys reach their adult life stage in the guts of
sharks. This larval plerocercoid was laying in wait inside a tuna,
hoping that its tuna host would deliver itself into the jaws of a shark
so that it could fulfill its tapeworm destiny to mate and produce eggs
in a shark intestine. The tiny tentacles that you see reaching out to
you are armed with hundreds of rows of backward-facing spikes. These
tentacles are used to attach the worm to the inside of the shark
intestine.</p>
<p>Not only do the cestodes have super complex life cycles, but their
body forms are wildly diverse, and they are just
<strong>heartbreakingly, staggeringly beautiful</strong>. You’ll get to
see that for yourself in this lab. We’ll have one species of cestodes
for you to discover very much alive. I hope you’ll come to love the
tapeworms as much as I do.</p>
<p>During this lab, we’ll also chat with you about the parasite species
you’re thinking about researching for your term paper and elevator
pitch. Remember that you’ll need to develop a plan to control,
eliminate, eradicate, or augment your parasite, and you’ll need to
support your proposed plan with evidence and logic. Our conversation
about this will be short this week - we just want to make sure that
everyone has at least one potential parasite species in mind, and that
not everyone has chosen the same parasite species! But do come to lab
with some ideas about parasite species you might be interested in
researching.</p>
<p>Phylum Platyhelminthes Class Cestoidea Subclass Eucestoda Order
Cyclophyllidea Family Hymenolepididae <em>Hymenolepis diminuta</em></p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="the-cestodes" class="section level4">
<h4>The cestodes</h4>
<p><br></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/cestode_cladogram.jpg"> <em></em>
</p>
<p>The class Cestoidea is the final group of platyhelminths we will
study. It is a very large group and entirely parasitic. Cestoidea are
unique among the platyhelminths in that they have no mouth and no gut;
they absorb all of their nutrients through their tegument (= external
body surface) directly from the host. The tegument is composed of tiny,
finger-like projections called microtriches, which increase the surface
area of absorption and are coated in a macromolecule layer that buffers
and protects the worm. Cestoideans are monoecious. The life history of
this group almost always involves one or more intermediate hosts with
larval stages that encyst and await being eaten by their successive host
(= trophic transmission).</p>
<p>The subclass Eucestoda is sometimes referred to as the “true
tapeworms” or “cestodes”. This group includes the long, segmented,
ribbon-like worms we normally associate with the term “tapeworm”. As
adults, eucestodes live in the intestines of vertebrates, where food is
always plentiful.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="general-morphology" class="section level5">
<h5>General morphology</h5>
<p>Morphologically, tapeworms have three distinct body regions. At the
extreme anterior end is the holdfast, called a <strong>scolex</strong>,
which may have various types of attachment structures (i.e., suckers,
acetabula, hooks, tentacles, muscular protrusions, etc.). Posterior to
the scolex, there is a short, unsegmented region called the
<strong>neck</strong>. The neck is quite narrow and is a very poorly
differentiated region. Within the neck region, however, is an area of
high mitotic activity. This growth zone is continuously differentiating
and is responsible for the proliferation of the segments, called
<strong>proglottids</strong>. Each proglottid eventually develops a set
of reproductive organs and is capable of generating many eggs. The
remainder of the body consists of a chain of proglottids and the chain
as a whole is referred to as the <strong>strobila</strong>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/cestode_morphology.gif"> <em></em>
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Closer observation of the strobili will reveal that the youngest
proglottids are the most anterior (nearest the neck) and the most mature
proglottids are at the posterior, “tail” end of the strobila. In the
youngest (most immature) proglottids, only the primordial reproductive
organs can be seen. As they develop and are pushed posteriorly, they
mature and become capable of producing fertilized eggs. Depending on the
taxon, some tapeworms retain proglottids on the strobila that have
completely filled with developing embryos (“<strong>gravid
proglottid</strong>”) that will eventually be expelled from the host
with fecal material. Other tapeworms “drop” mature proglottids from the
strobila and as separate entities, those mature proglottids can crawl
around in the intestine, complete reproduction, and expel their embryos.
Either way, fecal matter from infected hosts is loaded with tapeworm
eggs awaiting ingestion by the next host.</p>
<p>The various orders of Eucestoda can be distinguished on the basis of
the features of the scolex and the arrangement of the reproductive
organs in a mature proglottid. Be sure to observe the scolex morphology
and consider how it attaches to the villi on the mucosal surface of the
intestine. Does it appear to grasp the villi or does it appear to wedge
itself in the spaces between villi? In the mature proglottid, pay close
attention to the position of the ovary and vitellaria, the testes, the
cirrus sac, and the position of the genital pore.</p>
<p>One interesting factoid about cestodes is that they are shark
parasites that have evolved over time to exploit many different
vertebrate hosts. Of the 12 orders of tapeworms, 5 parasitize only
elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays). In fact, if you were to
examine a family of related shark species, you can almost overlay the
phylogeny of cestodes on that same cladogram. This relationship is an
example of co-evolution.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/cyclophyllidean_scolices.jpg"> <em>Scolices of
tapeworms in the Order Cyclophyllidea</em>
</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="order-cyclophyllidea" class="section level5">
<h5>Order Cyclophyllidea</h5>
<p>Cyclophyllideans comprise the characteristic cestode fauna of birds
and mammals; few species are found in reptiles. About 18 families of
cyclophyllideans are recognized, of which representatives of three
(Taeniidae, Hymenolepididae, and Dilepididae) are sometimes found in
humans. Pathology in humans is most severe when cyclophyllidean
tapeworms attempt to use humans as the intermediate host.</p>
<p>Cyclophyllideans have a scolex with four stout
<strong>acetabula</strong>. Most species bear a
<strong>rostellum</strong>, a protrusible crown on the apex of the
scolex that is sometimes armed with hooks. The <strong>vitelline
gland</strong> is a single, compact mass located posterior to the ovary
and medially in the proglottid; this feature is the most consistent for
identification of the cyclophyllideans. The <strong>ovary</strong> is
situated medially and is often bilobed, with a small ootype located
between its lobes. From the ootype, the vagina proceeds anteriorly, then
turns laterally to exit at the genital atrium. The
<strong>testes</strong> are usually follicular and numerous, but in some
groups such as <em>Hymenolepis</em> spp., they are compact and few in
number. Sperm collection ducts leave the testes and open into the vas
deferens, which terminates at the cirrus sac. In mature proglottids, the
<strong>uterus</strong> originates anterior to the ovary and develops
gradually, first as a median tube, and then begins to develop lateral
branches, or sometimes breaks down into numerous capsules containing
eggs (i.e., <em>Dipylidium</em>). Once the proglottid reaches the
<strong>gravid</strong> stage of maturity, the testes, ovary, and
vitellaria can no longer be seen, as they have spent all resources and
diminished to allow room for expansion of the uterus. Unlike other
cestode orders, eggs of cyclophyllideans have a thick, radially-striated
embryophore, a protective outer layer surrounding the embryo. Remember
that the host groups of cyclophyllideans are terrestrial and therefore
eggs deposited in feces will likely be exposed to the drying elements of
the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The life cycles of cyclophyllideans is different than many other
cestode orders in that they do not require second intermediate hosts;
therefore the plerocercoid stage is skipped. Most of the cyclophyllidean
life cycles do require one intermediate host, an arthropod or mammal,
depending on the species. Typically, the adult worm lives in the
intestine of the definitive host and expels eggs that exit the host with
the feces. The intermediate host ingests the egg stage. Gastric
intestinal fluid triggers the egg to hatch and an oncosphere emerges.
With its 6 hooks, the oncosphere burrows out of the intestine wall and
migrates through the host to encyst. The definitive host becomes
infected by eating the intermediate host tissues, which contain the
larval cysts. The larval stages develop in a variety of ways and can
cause moderate to severe pathology in the intermediate host.</p>

<h5><em>Taenia saginata</em> – beef tapeworm</h5>
<ul>
<li>Only humans can serve as the definitive host. Cattle often serve as
the intermediate host, with larvae encysting in the muscle fibers of
cattle.</li>
<li>Adult worms lack a rostellum and armature on the scolex. Mature
worms are typically 3 to 5 meters in their human host and can get up to
20m long! The uterus of a gravid proglottid has 15 to 20 lateral
branches per side. Pathology in humans is mild.</li>
<li>Larval worms encysted in the intermediate host are called cysticerci
(singular: cysticercus). For each egg that the intermediate host
ingests, one cysticercus will develop in the tissue. In the larval form
the scolex is formed but invaginated. Cysticerci typically encyst in
muscle fibers. Infection of humans as intermediate hosts is not
common.</li>

<h5><em>Echinococcus granulosus</em></h5>
<ul>
<li>Carnivores serve as definitive hosts and herbivorous mammals serve
as intermediate hosts. In the <strong>wild</strong>, the life cycle may
occur in wolves and moose, lions and warthogs, or dingoes and wallabys
(<strong>sylvatic life cycle</strong>). The life cycle can also occur
between domestic dogs and domestic livestock (sheep, rabbits, goats,
etc.). When the tapeworm enters a domestic animal, humans are at greater
risk of being infected, usually by handling dogs and encountering eggs
in fecal matter. The disease in humans when they become intermediate
hosts of this tapeworm is called <em>hydatidosis</em> or hydatid
disease.</li>
<li>Adult worms possess an armed rostellum. Mature worms are small at
about 5mm. The strobila usually consists of only 3 proglottids, where
the terminal one is gravid.</li>
<li>The larval worms often target the liver and lungs of the
intermediate host to encyst. They develop into a specific type of
bladder worm called a <strong>unilocular hydatid</strong>. Over time,
the inner layer of the hydatid becomes a germinal layer from which
<strong>brood capsules</strong> arise. Each brood capsule buds off
inside the hydatid and develops its own germinal layer from which
protoscolices arise. The hydatid grows very large and essentially is a
sac full of brood capsules, which are full of protoscolices, the texture
of which is referred to as “<strong>hydatid sand</strong>”. Hydatids can
grow to be enormous, holding 15 quarts of fluid. Imagine the severity if
a hydatid develops inside a human in the liver, lungs, or brain! The
danger of anaphylactic shock is great if the hydatid ruptures and
releases antigenic material.</li>

<p>You’ve now seen at least a few nematodes from your fish dissection.
This week, we will take a deep dive into this fascinating clade of
parasites. You will come face-to-face with a disturbingly large (but
thankfully dead) human-infecting nematode and some living
insect-infecting nematodes. Remember to keep careful track of your
observations in your lab notebook and make sure to finish reading the
entire Lab 5 overview before your lab section meets!</p>
<p>The nematodes are an astoundingly large and speciose group of worms.
Free-living nematodes are abundant in every habitat from marine and
freshwater to soil. Parasitism is believed to have evolved in the
nematodes a number of times from free-living forms. Today, parasitic
nematodes are found in every vertebrate group, many of the invertebrate
groups, and even in plants! In terms of abundance and number of species,
nematodes outrank even the arthropods. Humans are hosts to a fair few
species of nematodes, some of which are extremely pathogenic.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Nematodes have a gestalt body form that is surprisingly similar and
recognizable across the entire phylum. Yet, their sizes can range from
less than a millimeter to nearly a meter in length. Typically, the body
is bilaterally symmetrical, long, slender, and tapering at both ends.
Their movement is distinctly <strong>sinusoidal</strong>, owing to their
longitudinal muscle and lack of circular and transverse musculature. The
outer part of the body is covered by a <strong>cuticle</strong>
(noncellular, proteinaceous layer) that is excreted from an underlying
dermal layer. The cuticle is molted a number of times during larval
development, analogous to the way that arthropods molt their
exoskeletons. The cuticle serves many functions, including protection
from desiccation, a barrier to host immune response, and a turgid
surface for the hydrostatic muscle contraction during movement. The
mouth is located at the anterior end and is surrounded by a tripartite
opening. A muscular pharynx follows and a tubular intestine runs the
length of the body, terminating at the anus, which opens at the
posterior half of the body.</p>
<p>Nematodes have separate male and female sexes (with rare exceptions).
In many species, there is a high degree of <strong>sexual
dimorphism</strong>, whereby the male and female morphology and overall
size are quite different. In males, the reproductive system consists of
testes, which are glandular and elongate throughout the body. In most
species, males have <strong>copulatory spicules</strong> located at the
posterior end of the worm. The spicules are eversible and used to
position the female and hold the vulva open for sperm transfer during
copulation. In some species, the male is also equipped with a
<strong>copulatory bursa</strong>, a cup-shaped posterior end with
finger-like rays used for grasping the female. The females are typically
larger and the reproductive system consists of an elongate
<strong>ovary</strong> that empties into the egg-filled
<strong>uterus</strong>. The coils of the uterus terminate at a genital
pore opening called the <strong>vulva</strong>.</p>
<p>Egg morphology is distinct. Most species have a unique shape,
facilitating diagnosis. The timing of embryonation can vary; some
embryonate while still in the female uterus and others embryonate in the
external environment. In the external environment, some eggs will remain
dormant and others will hatch and the larvae will begin to develop and
molt before encountering its host.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="life-cycles" class="section level5">
<h5>Life cycles</h5>
<p>Life cycles of parasitic nematodes vary among species. In some, there
is no intermediate host involved. For direct life cycle nematodes, egg
stages can be ingested by the host or juvenile stages can actively
penetrate the host’s skin. Some nematodes use intermediate hosts, where
they encyst in tissues and are trophically transmitted. Still others use
vector intermediate hosts that actively transmit the infection between
hosts. Nematodes that we will study today live in the gut of vertebrates
as adult worms, and most have direct life cycles.</p>

<div id="hookworm" class="section level5">
<h5>Hookworm</h5>
<p>Species of hookworms live in the intestine of their hosts, attaching
to the mucosal surface and feeding on blood. They are distinctive in
that they possess a <strong>buccal capsule</strong>, a large and heavily
sclerotized “mouth” that is armed with cutting plates, teeth, or
lancet-like structures. Eggs are passed in the feces. Juvenile stages
emerge in the external environment and molt twice. The <strong>J3
stage</strong> (third-stage juvenile) is infective. Upon contact with
the host, the J3 penetrates the host’s skin and enters the circulatory
system, where they proceed to the lungs by way of small vessels leading
to alveoli. The juveniles <strong>migrate</strong> through the lung, up
the trachea, and down the esophagus to gain access to the intestine,
where thy mature, mate, and produce eggs. Pathology is <strong>intensity
dependent</strong> and can be severe. Hookworm eggs are large, oval, and
often with a juvenile that is globular in appearance.</p>

<h5>True roundworms</h5>
<div id="ascaris-lumbricoides" class="section level6">
<h6><em>Ascaris lumbricoides</em></h6>
<p>These are among the largest nematodes in existence. Males reach
lengths of 15–31 cm, while females reach lengths of 20–50 cm. They are
parasites of humans but can also live in pigs. High intensity infections
may cause intestinal blockage and result in severe pathology. The eggs
are round and have a ruffled <strong>mammilated</strong> layer that is
unmistakable. The eggs are highly resistant and can survive in the
environment under stressful conditions for years.</p>
<p>The life cycle of <em>Ascaris</em> is similar to that of hookworms,
except that hosts are normally infected by ingesting the eggs. Once in
the stomach, the juvenile hatches and burrows out of the stomach and
into the circulatory system. Juveniles exit small vessels near alveoli
and enter the lungs. Inside the lungs, juveniles molt twice, and then
proceed to crawl up the trachea, down the esophagus, and eventually
arrive at the intestine. <em>Ascaris</em> is believed by some to be
related to the hookworms, and this juvenile migration may be a relict
part of the life cycle.</p>

<h5>Pinworm</h5>
<p>This group of nematodes contains species that infect mammals
(including humans) and many that infect reptiles and insects. Most are
known to have simple, direct life cycles. Study the general appearance
of the male and female worms, noting their relative sizes. Observe that
the female has a slender, pointed tail (hence the common name pinworm).
Eggs of this group are characteristically large, oval, and flattened on
one side. Developing larvae can often be seen in the eggs.</p>
<div id="enterobius-vermicularis" class="section level6">
<h6><em>Enterobius vermicularis</em></h6>
<p>This species is common in the intestine of humans and causes mild
illness in children, but is not very pathogenic in adults. In the region
of the head are two cuticular expansions, <strong>cervical
alae</strong>. The <strong>caudal alae</strong> (at the posterior) are
narrow and less well-defined. Study the morphology of male and female
worms. Identify the vulva and uterus in the female and testis in the
male. The male tail is curved and short and bears a single spicule.</p>
<p>The life cycle of <em>E. vermicularis</em> is direct but the females
exhibit a particular behavior to increase the chance of
<strong>autoinfection</strong> (a person infecting him/herself). Often
at night, while the host is sleeping, a female nematode will creep near
the anus and deposit eggs on the skin along with an itchy substance.
Children especially are likely to scratch the itchy area, acquire the
eggs on their fingers, and ingest them.</p>

<h5>Whipworm</h5>
<div id="trichuris-trichiura" class="section level6">
<h6><em>Trichuris trichiura</em></h6>
<p>This species is a parasite of primates (including humans) and pigs.
The body is whip-like with two distinct regions. The long, slender half
is the anterior. The mouth occurs at the tiny tip and the esophagus is
long and narrow. The intestine begins where the body of the worm
thickens. Note the single spicule of the male. Eggs are very distinctive
with an oval shell and <strong>polar knobs</strong> at either end. The
life cycle is direct and people become infected by ingesting eggs from
the external environment. Eggs embryonate in the external environment in
moist, shady soil. Once ingested, the larva emerges and penetrates into
the mucosal tissue of the large intestine down to the basal cells. They
remain embedded, feeding on cell debris and blood. As they mature, the
thick body of the worm protrudes into the lumen, expelling eggs.
Pathology is not severe in adults with low-intensity infections, but
children or immune-compromised individuals with high intensity
infections are at risk of dysentery and anemia caused by chronic
hemorrhaging of the intestinal wall.</p>
</div>
<div id="trichinella-sprialis" class="section level6">
<h6><em>Trichinella sprialis</em></h6>
<p>This species is parasitic in humans and many other mammals, domestic
and wild. Pathology can be severe in human infections. Adult worms live
in the small intestine. Once a female worm is fertilized (mated), she
will penetrate the mucosal lining of the intestine and deposit larvae
into the circulatory system. Hundreds of larvae circulate and seek out
muscle tissue (i.e., heart, diaphragm, etc.). A juvenile will enter a
host cell and encyst intracellularly, converting all of that cell’s
metabolic functions toward its own development. The host cell, called a
nurse cell, provides a contained, protected juvenile package. When the
host dies and another mammal feeds on the infected tissue, the juvenile
springs into action in the new intestine, ready to mature and continue
the cycle. Thus, each host that is infected with adult worms becomes the
proprietor of the juvenile infective to the next host in its own
tissues.</p>
<p>Examine sections of infected muscle tissue. The juveniles often are
rolled up spirally (to fit inside the elongate cells). After time,
calcareous granules may accumulate around the cyst/nurse cell, and
eventually the cell and the worm may become calcified. Imagine the
long-term effects on the human if thousands of cells experience this
infection. It is extremely difficult to treat, as the problem is
intracellular.</p>

<div id="filarial-nematodes" class="section level5">
<h5>Filarial nematodes</h5>
<p>Filarial worms are a group of tissue-dwelling nematodes that infect
terrestrial vertebrate hosts. Adult worms are very long and slender
(<strong>filiform</strong>) with reduced features. Filarial worms cause
some of the most pathogenic diseases in humans and domestic animals. All
species use <strong>arthropods</strong> as intermediate hosts.</p>
<p>Members of the family Onchocercidae employ the arthropod intermediate
host as a <strong>vector</strong>. A vector host actively transfers
infective stages of the parasite from one host to another when feeding.
Among onchocercids, adult females are <strong>ovoviviparous</strong>,
giving birth to active juveniles called <strong>microfilariae</strong>.
The female worm often deposits microfilariae directly into the
circulatory system of the host. Thousands of microfilariae circulate,
navigating to the peripheral blood vessels to increase their chances of
being ingested by an appropriate arthropod vector species. Once inside
the proper intermediate host, the microfilariae will molt and undergo
further development. When the arthropod takes another blood meal, the
infective larvae exit the arthropod onto the skin of the vertebrate and
penetrate the bite wound to gain access into the new definitive host.
Microfilariae are often the diagnostic stage used by physicians, since a
simple blood smear of an infected individual will often yield
microfilariae. Microfilariae are <strong>multinucleate</strong> and
sometimes retain the egg membrane as a <strong>sheath</strong>. The
extent of nuclei and presence of a sheath are characters used to
distinguish species. Microfilariae often exhibit
<strong>periodicity</strong>, whereby they are found in highest
densities in the peripheral blood vessels close to the skin at specific
times of the day to coincide with the peak feeding activity of their
vector host.</p>
<div id="dirofilaria-immitis" class="section level6">
<h6><em>Dirofilaria immitis</em></h6>
<p>This species is primarily a parasite of dogs but many other mammals
are susceptible. The disease is commonly referred to as
“<strong>heartworm</strong>”, as adult worms live in the right side of
the heart and pulmonary artery. Infection in dogs can lead to
cardiopulmonary failure and death if untreated.</p>
<p>The life cycle of <em>D. immitis</em> involves a mosquito as the
vector host. Adult worms live in the heart and females release
microfilariae directly into the bloodstream. Mosquitoes ingest the
microfilariae while taking a blood meal. Inside the mosquito, the
nematode larvae molt in the Malpighian tubules to become J3s (3rd
juvenile stage). The J3s migrate to the mouthparts of the mosquito so
that they can readily drop onto the vertebrate host’s skin while the
mosquito is taking its next blood meal. The J3s use the mosquito bite
wound to enter the host and advance into the circulatory system. Mature
worms can be found in the heart after about five months.</p>
</div>
<div id="onchocerca-volvulus" class="section level6">
<h6><em>Onchocerca volvulus</em></h6>
<p>This species causes a disease in humans known as
<strong>onchocerciasis</strong>, also known as <strong>river
blindness</strong>. Its distribution includes Africa, Arabia, and the
tropical Americas. Adult worms live <strong>subcutaneously</strong> near
the bite wound of the insect vector (black flies, <strong>Family
Simuliidae</strong>). Adult worms live in pairs or groups and become
encapsulated in host collagen material, forming a fibrous nodule
(<strong>onchocercoma</strong>) beneath the skin. Females release
unsheathed microfilariae that remain in the skin tissue. Black fly
vectors will ingest the microfilariae when biting. In the black fly, the
nematode larvae molt to become J3s and migrate to the labium so that
they can easily exit the black fly when it takes another blood meal, and
enter the bite wound.</p>
<p>Adult worms and microfilariae cause pathology in infected
individuals. The onchocercomas, containing adult worms, are not terribly
symptomatic, but can occur wherever the person has been bitten (arms,
legs, back, pelvic area, chest, head). The microfilariae cause greater
problems. They are released by the hundreds and invade subcutaneous
tissues all over the body, eliciting inflammatory response and causing
dermatitis and lesions. Blindness occurs frequently when the
microfilariae invade the eye and then die, causing lesions and scarring
of the cornea over time. This is especially common when bite wounds are
on the head. As the black flies are common in fast-moving stream areas,
the disease has long been known as river blindness.</p>
</div>
<div id="wuchereria-bancrofti" class="section level6">
<h6><em>Wuchereria bancrofti</em></h6>
<p>This species causes a disease in humans called lymphatic filariasis
(you may sometimes see it called by an old name that I don’t recommend
you use because it stigmatizes patients: elephantiasis). Its
distribution is across the equatorial belt worldwide. Adult worms live
in the lymphatic ducts near major lymph glands, primarily in the lower
half of the body. Females release sheathed microfilariae into the lymph
system, which merges with the general circulatory system. Microfilariae
of this species often demonstrate <strong>periodicity</strong>, whereby
they migrate to the peripheral blood vessels near the skin during the
late evening hours when the mosquito vectors are biting.</p>
<p>Adult worms cause most of the pathology associated with this parasite
by eliciting a strong immune response and inflammation of the affected
area. Secondary bacterial infections further exacerbate the problem and,
over time, blockages of the afferent lymph system can occur. Over the
long term, areas afflicted by the adult worms near the lymph nodes can
become scarred over with fibrous material generated from the host immune
response. Lymph fluid collects and is trapped in the affected appendage
causing a painfully swollen condition.</p>
</div>
<div id="loa-loa" class="section level6">
<h6><em>Loa loa</em></h6>
<p>This species affects humans and is known as the “eyeworm”. Its
distribution is in tropical West Africa. Adult worms live subcutaneously
and are mobile. Microfilariae exhibit periodicity and appear in the
peripheral blood during daylight hours. The vector is the biting deer
fly (Chrysops spp.). Pathology is not as severe as other onchocercid
nematodes, but adults can elicit an inflammatory immune response in
subcutaneous tissue, called Calabar swellings. The swelling disappears
after the worm moves on. Occasionally, worms enter the conjunctiva of
the eye and can be seen crawling within the white tissue, hence the
common name.</p>
</div>
<div id="dracunculus-medinensis" class="section level6">
<h6><em>Dracunculus medinensis</em></h6>
<p>This species is also known as the <strong>Guinea worm</strong>. Its
distribution includes Africa, India, and the Middle East. <em>D.
medinensis</em> infects humans and is one of the longest nematodes
known; females reach up to 80 cm! Adult worms are tissue-dwellers, often
inhabiting the lower extremities. Female worms have a uterus with
extensive branching. Gravid females are so full of developing embryos
that a strong internal pressure is created within the worm. The female
migrates near to the skin surface and a portion of her cuticle erupts,
forcing juveniles out into the subcutaneous layer. The host immune
system reacts and a blister forms at the site of the eruption. When the
host wades into cool water, such as in a stream, the female nematode
begins contractions, forcing juveniles out of the blister wound. The
juveniles enter the water and are readily consumed by the intermediate
host, a <strong>cyclopoid copepod</strong>. In the arthropod host, the
larval nematode migrates to the hemocoel and molts to become the J3
infective stage. Humans become infected by drinking water containing
infected copepods. In the human, the nematode penetrates the duodenum
and abdominal muscles to enter the subcutaneous connective tissues,
where it will mature.</p>
<p>Pathology is caused by the secondary infections that are likely to
occur when a gravid female induces the blister wound. Removing the worm
is tricky, and if it breaks, antigenic substances are released deep

<h4>Demonstration instructions</h4>
<p><strong>Adult <em>Ascaris</em> spp. nematode dissection</strong></p>
<p>Obtain an <em>Ascaris lumbricoides</em> or <em>Ascaris suum</em> worm
for dissection. Wear gloves and be careful – these eggs have a small
chance of being viable, despite fixation in formalin!</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Find the mouth at the anterior end, noting the three lips, one
dorsal and two lateroventral.</li>
<li>Affix the worm in a dissecting pan dorsal side up by piercing with a
pin near the anterior end. Carefully slit open the body from the
anterior working posterior, pinning down the flaps of the cuticle as you
go. Observe the body cavity and the hydrostatic pressure that would
exist in a live worm.</li>
<li>Observe the different regions of the alimentary canal: an esophagus,
a muscular pharynx, a simple flat intestine, and the position along the
body where the anus exits.</li>
<li>In a female specimen, the <strong>vulva</strong> is situated
midventrally and about one third down from the anterior end of the worm.
The <strong>vagina</strong> is a short tube connecting the vulva to the
bifurcated uterus. The two branches of the uterus coil posteriorly and
then anteriorly, becoming <strong>oviduct</strong> along the way. The
<strong>ovary</strong> lies at the terminal end, where the oviduct is
coiled and fine. Eggs simply move along the oviduct and end up in the
uterus, where they can be fertilized by the male.</li>
<li>In a male specimen, there is a single <strong>testis</strong>, a
long, fine, tightly coiled tube that is continuous posteriorly with a
wider tube, the <strong>seminal vesicle</strong>. The latter organ leads
into a short, muscular <strong>ejaculatory duct</strong>, which opens
into the cloaca. Two <strong>spicules</strong> arise in pouches of the
cloaca and may be seen projecting from the anus.</li>
<li>Be sure to observe the morphology of both sexes: examine a
neighbor’s specimen. When finished, please dispose of all tissues in the
designated trash. <strong>Wash equipment and hands thoroughly with soap.
Bleach surfaces.</strong></li>

<h3>Lab 6</h3>
<p><strong>Readings</strong>: <em>How to Do Ecology</em> Chapter 8</p>
<p>As we’ve traversed the parasite tree of life , we’ve so far focused
primarily on vermiform parasites (i.e., wormy dudes). Today, you’ll get
to come face-to-face with a different group of parasites: the arthropods
(i.e., crunchy dudes).</p>
<p>For the past several weeks, we have been raising our very own colony
of arthropod parasites: jewel wasp (<em>Melittobia digitata</em>)
parasitoids of blow fly pupae (<em>Sarcophaga</em> spp.). We’ve already
seen several generations of wasps deposit their eggs in blow fly pupae,
create their own pupae, and metamorphose into adult jewel wasps.</p>
<p>Today, you will:</p>

<h4>Demonstration instructions</h4>
<p>Today’s demonstration will have two parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You’ll perform a dissection of shore crabs (<em>Hemigrapsus
oregonensis</em> or <em>H. nudus</em>) infected with the entoniscid
isopod <em>Portunion conformis</em></p></li>
<li><p>You’ll extract and visualize your own facial mites (<em>Demodex
folliculorum</em> and <em>D. brevis</em>)</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Entoniscid isopod <em>Portunion conformis</em></strong></p>
<p>Euthanizing crabs can be challenging, and we want to make sure that
(1) the crabs are all dispatched humanely and (2) you guys aren’t too
traumatized by the process of performing the euthanasia on your own. So
your TA will do all the euthanasias and present you with freshly dead
crabs for your dissections.</p>
<p><em>Portunion conformis</em> is an endoparasite of the local shore
crabs, <em>Hemigrapsus oregonensis</em> and <em>H. nudus</em>. These
parasites actually feminize male hosts, which is apparent in mature
infections but may be subtle.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Obtain your freshly dead crab. Your TA will sever the cerebral
ganglion for you. The legs might kick for a few more seconds, but these
are just reflexes - the crab isn’t feeling a thing.</li>
<li>Record the species, sex, collection data, and the carapace width of
each crab.</li>
<li>Make a drawing of the crab, especially the morphology of its
abdomen.</li>
<li>Gently flip back the abdominal flap. If a lemon yellow spot is
visible at the base of the abdomen, you’ll know that the crab is
infected with an adult female <em>Portunion conformis</em>. If the
yellow spot is lacking, you will look carefully for the more subtle
signs of an early infection. If the host is female, look through the
thin, transparent membrane alongside the intestines on the underside of
the abdomen. Normally, the blood is colorless, but if the blood appears
brown, the crab is infected with a juvenile parasite. Consumption of the
host ovary by the young parasite releases brown vitelline pigment into
the blood of the host, resulting in brown coloration. Write down your
observations.</li>
<li>From here on out, we’ll proceed with caution, as the parasite is
large, morphologically complex, and intertwined with host tissue.</li>
<li>Insert a scalpel at the posterior-lateral corner of the carapace
where it joins the abdomen. Then lift the carapace carefully to expose
the hemocoel of the crab.</li>
<li>Mature parasites should be immediately apparent; the female looks
vaguely maggot-like and is pale yellow, orange, or white. If a large
parasite is present, you should carefully sever the intestine (the most
fragile part of the parasite underlies the intestine). Using forceps as
a scoop, gently flip the parasite from the cavity of the thorax into the
still partially attached carapace. Most of the host’s organs may
accompany the parasite in this maneuver. Then float the parasite out by
placing the “backed” crab in a watchglass and covering with
seawater.</li>
<li>Examine the crab under the dissecting microscope and carefully
dissect the parasite from the carapace. The anterior portion of the
parasite’s brood chamber (marsupium) is interdigitated with the host’s
organs in the anterior part of the carapace, in front of the host’s
mouthpart musculature (buccal apparatus). The parasite may most easily
be removed if the host’s buccal apparatus is lifted in toto and the
parasite scooped out of the empty shell.</li>
<li>Draw the female entoniscid. If you don’t find one, draw your
neighbor’s.</li>
<li>Try to find the dwarf male hanging out nearby.</li>
<li>If the female is carrying epicaridian larvae, draw those too.</li>
<li>Remember to label the structures in your drawings of the females,
males, and epicaridian larvae.</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Facial mites (<em>Demodex follicularum</em> and <em>D.
brevis</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The vast majority of adult humans host the human eyebrow mite,
<em>Demodex folliculorum</em>, an ectoparasite of the human face. Mites
burrow into hair follicles of eyebrows and eyelashes and lay their long
bodies parallel to the emerging hair. These mites are most active at
night. Those humans who do not contract the mites vertically (e.g., from
nuzzling mom as an infant) probably contract mites horizontally (e.g.,
later in life, from nuzzling other folks at night). Mites have been
weakly linked to some skin diseases, but are thought to be largely
harmless. We will assay your face for <em>Demodex folliculorum</em>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There are several ways to do this. We will start by crazy-gluing a
piece of transparent tape to a microscope slide, sticky side up. Once
the glue is dry, apply the sticky tape to your eyebrow line, press
firmly, and remove. If you’re lucky, several tiny hairs (along with
their associated follicles) will be removed by the tape.</li>
<li>Drop a bit of mineral oil on the tape, add a cover slip, and examine
under low magnification on a compound microscope.</li>
<li>You can also try “expressing” the mites - this is a fancy way of
saying, “squeeze your skin like you’re popping a zit and scrape the oil
onto a microscope slide”. Around the eyebrows and nose are popular
places for mites. Once you have the oil on a slide, drop some mineral
oil on top, add a cover slip, and examine under low magnification on a
compound microscope.</li>
<li>This might require a few tries. <em>Demodex follicularum</em> can be
tough to get a hold of during daytime hours.</li>
<li>Once we find a mite, please make a detailed drawing and label as
many structures as you can. If you don’t find your own mites, draw your
neighbor’s.</li>
