<h3>Lab 1</h3>
<p><strong>It’ll be barely visible at first: a twitch.</strong> A white
mouse will be laid on its back on your desk, pinned to a wax tray, its
organs exposed.Itself freshly dead, the mouse’s schistosome parasites
will still be alive. Just within the hepatic portal vein and visible
across the thin wall of the vessel, paired male and female worms will
thrash, sensing their host’s demise.When I see this, I’m always
awestruck at the devastation wreaked on the liver by wayward
<em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> eggs, at the organ’s distention, its mounds
of granulomas. I’m also awestruck at the thought that such eggs are – at
this very moment – navigating the same winding route through human
bodies, causing the same pathology.</p>

<p>This year, I’ll kick off our labs by throwing you into the deep end
of the parasitology pool. In our first lab, you will get to see
<strong>live schistosome adults in mice and hatch their eggs into
miracidia.</strong> You’ll also get to see <strong>another species of
trematode in its snail intermediate host</strong>. For this and all
future labs, you’ll be responsible for keeping a laboratory notebook of
your observations. Make sure to finish reading the content on Lab 1
before your lab section meets!</p>

<h4>Phylum Platyhelminthes</h4>
<p>The platyhelminths are commonly referred to as “flatworms”, since
they are typically dorsoventrally flattened. This large and diverse
phylum is comprised of four major classes (Turbellaria, Trematoda,
Monogenea, and Cestoidea) that we will study in more depth throughout
the next few labs. The hypothetical relationships of these major groups
are shown in the cladogram below, which traces the common ancestry among
the groups. The platyhelminths as a group provide an exciting
introduction to parasitology because one can trace the evolution and
specialization for parasitism throughout the group. While studying the
flatworms, pay particular attention to the reproductive anatomy,
reproductive capacity, adaptations for a parasitic life style, and
transmission stages.</p>

<div id="the-trematode-life-cycle" class="section level4">
<h4>The trematode life cycle</h4>
<p>The digenetic trematodes comprise a truly marvelous array of
families, genera, and species. Classification of the Digenea is
determined on the basis of the size, shape, and placement of suckers,
arrangement of flame cells, and especially on details of the
reproductive system. The Digenea are one of the largest platyhelminth
groups, with an estimated 40,000 described species in at least 125
families. Taxonomy in this large group is still in a dynamic state.</p>
<p>The majority of the Digenea are equipped with two muscular suckers.
The largest of these, the acetabulum (ventral sucker), is located on the
ventral surface of the worm and serves as an attachment structure. The
oral sucker surrounds the mouth and is located at the anterior end of
the worm. Most digenes are less than 30 mm in length and many species
are less than 3 mm. On the other hand, Hirudinella, a species found in
the stomach of some marine fish species, may attain the length and girth
of a summer squash. Here’s a video of an adult Hirudinella marina, which
Chelsea dissected from the stomach of a pelagic wahoo (please forgive
the way the camera moves and the noise in the background - this video
was taken on a sailing research vessel on the high seas!):</p>

<p>The ordinal name, Digenea, refers to the fact that the life cycle of
these flatworms involves an alternation of hosts, with asexual
reproduction occurring in intermediate hosts. As many as three
intermediate hosts and a single definitive host may be required to
complete a digenetic trematode life cycle. The first intermediate host
is typically a gastropod (snail). The definitive host is always a
vertebrate. Asexual reproduction in parasites may occur in intermediate
hosts; sexual reproduction (cross-fertilization of the hermaphroditic
worms) occurs only in the definitive host.</p>
<p>Adult digenetic trematodes (known as “flukes” in the common
vernacular) are typically found in the digestive tract and associated
viscera of definitive hosts but may be found in almost any organ or
tissue. The vertebrate definitive hosts typically have high vagility
(i.e., they move across long distances), which facilitates the
distribution of parasite eggs. All vertebrate classes serve as hosts to
these parasites. Digenetic trematodes are economically and medically
significant, as some species cause serious pathology in domestic animals
and humans.</p>
<p>The digenetic trematodes have some of the most complicated life
histories in the animal kingdom. Digenetic trematode life cycles are
“indirect” or “complex”, meaning that more than one host species is
required to complete the life cycle. All species have asexually and
sexually reproducing life states and a minimum of two hosts: a
<strong>first intermediate host</strong> and a <strong>definitive
host</strong>. Many taxa incorporate a second or third intermediate host
as well. Although this may, at first, seem confusing, there are really
two basic variations to the theme as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Taxa that have an intermediate host (usually a snail) and a
definitive host (vertebrate) only.</li>
<li>Taxa that incorporate additional intermediate hosts (which may be
mollusks, annelids, arthropods, or vertebrates) between the first
intermediate and definitive hosts.</li>
</ol>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/trematode_lc.png">
</p>
<p>Asexual reproduction occurs in the intermediate host. Sexual
reproduction, resulting in the production of eggs, occurs only in the
definitive host. There are three distinct larval stages involved in all
digenetic trematode life cycles: the <strong>miracidium</strong>,
<strong>sporocyst</strong>, and <strong>cercaria</strong>. Some taxa
also produce <strong>rediae</strong> and/or encysted
<strong>metacercariae</strong>. All of these life stages except for the
miracidium can be found in first intermediate hosts. One of the many
interesting aspects of digenetic trematode parasite life cycles is the
parasitic castration of the first intermediate host. Parasitic
castration is the elimination of reproductive capability in the host,
and results from consumption of and interference with the gonad tissue
by larval digenetic trematode parasites. The castrated host continues to
live and compete with uninfected individuals in the host population, but
only produces larval parasites.</p>
<p><strong>Miracidium:</strong> The miracidium is the larval stage that
develops within the egg produced by the adult fluke in the definitive
host. After hatching from the egg, miracidia are infective to the first
intermediate host. The miracidium is a minute, ovoid, aquatic, motile
stage covered with cilia. These cilia are shed when infection is
initiated by penetration of the host or consumption of embyronated eggs
by an appropriate host. In the video below, you will see a miracidium
(of the trematode species Fasciola hepatica) hatching out of its egg,
using its cilia to swim away, and leaving behind an empty eggshell:</p>

class="uri">https://youtu.be/78u7YKKPEKY</a></p>
<p><strong>Sporocyst:</strong> Infection of the first intermediate hosts
begins when the miracidium enters that host and becomes a primary or
“mother” sporocyst. The primary sporocyst gives rise to a second
generation asexually; the second generation may be daughter sporocysts
or rediae. Embryos within the daughter sporocysts may produce another
generation of sporocysts, rediae, or cercariae. Sporocysts are
“sack-like” organisms with no mouth or digestive system. The sporocyst
absorbs nutrients directly from host tissue to supply the developing
larvae.</p>
<p><strong>Rediae:</strong> SOME groups of digeneans produce rediae.
Rediae have a rudimentary digestive system consisting of a mouth,
muscular pharynx, and short, unbranched gut; this larval stage may be
distinguished from a sporocyst based on the presence of these
structures. Rediae can be quite active and even downright aggressive,
feeding actively on host tissue and sometimes upon other larval
trematodes within the host. Note that not all digenean trematodes
possess a redia stage – some only produce sporocysts.</p>
<p><strong>Cercariae:</strong> Cercariae are asexually produced by
sporocysts or rediae, depending on the species of trematode. Cercariae
are free-swimming, sperm-like creatures that encyst in or penetrate the
next host. Three different scenarios are possible:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Penetration of a second intermediate host and development of an
encysted stage (metacercaria) in that host.</li>

<p>In the video below, you can see cercariae spilling out of burst
sporocysts dissected from a snail intermediate host (note that you can
see the ventral suckers clear as day on each cercaria!):</p>

<p><strong>Metacercariae:</strong> The metacercaria is an encysted
larval stage that occurs in many digenean life cycles. Metacercariae are
infective to the definitive host in the life cycle. Infection of the
definitive host by a metacercaria is always trophic: the definitive host
consumes the metacercariae in an infected intermediate host or on food
items. Metacercaria can develop in both invertebrate and vertebrate
hosts and on invertebrates. The developing fluke may be visible inside
of the cyst (as in the illustration below):</p>

<p>Having trouble keeping track of the trematode life cycle? <em>The
Oatmeal</em> is here to help! <a

illustrates the three-host life cycle of one trematode (<em>Dicrocoelium
dendriticum</em>) in a… memorable… way.</p>

<h4>Order Strigeiformes</h4>
<p>The Order Strigeiformes is pretty unique among the trematodes:
instead of a three-host life cycle, the Srigeiformes use only two hosts
(a first intermediate snail and a vertebrate definitive host). The Order
Srigeiformes includes those digene species whose cercariae have forked
tails. The cercariae also possess specialized glands for penetration of
the hosts. The digenetic trematodes in the Superfamily Schistosomatoidea
are usually <strong>dioecious</strong>, having separate male and female
worms. The schistosomes are our representative material for this order,
but they are <strong>unusual in many ways and highly adapted for
parasitism</strong>. Adult worms live permanently in copula within the
host.</p>
<p><br></p>

</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schistosomes are long, thin worms, an adaptation to living in the
small blood vessels of the mammalian hepatic portal system. The
<strong>oral sucker</strong> and <strong>acetabulum</strong> are
adjacent in these worms. The male is recognized by the presence of the
<strong>gynecophoric canal</strong>, a deep groove on the ventral
surface that holds the female worm. The testis is also usually visible
in stained specimens. The <strong>genital pore</strong> is just
posterior to the acetabulum in the female worm. Lateral
<strong>vitellaria</strong> occupy the posterior half of the body and
the compact ovary is previtelline. The digestive <strong>caecae</strong>
are usually visible as dark coiled tubes. What are these worms
eating?</p>

<p>Schistosome cercariae are fork-tailed. Once released from their snail
hosts, they swim through the water column, seeking out a vertebrate
definitive host. In the case of <em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> and
<em>Schistosoma haematobium</em>, the definitive hosts are human, and
they infect human hosts by penetrating the skin of people bathing in
streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds containing snails. In lab, you will
see only the adult and egg stages of this parasite, not the cercariae
(even though the Wood Lab does keep living schistosome cercariae in its
biosafety-level 2 facility). Why am I not giving you schistosome
cercariae to handle?</p>

<h5><em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> adults in the vertebrate definitive
host</h5>
<p>Schistosomiasis (human infection with schistosome worms) is a
debilitating disease, rarely killing but often disabling infected
individuals. Today we will see the destructiveness of schistosomes
firsthand. The US National Institutes of Health maintains the life cycle
of <em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> in their laboratories near Washington,
DC, using <em>Biomphalaria glabrata</em> snails as intermediate hosts
and laboratory mice as definitive hosts. They provide infected mice to
research and teaching laboratories around the country. We have access to
these infected animals for our teaching laboratory. These mice gave
their lives for science, so please treat them with respect.</p>
<p>Mice are great models for human schistosomiasis. Much of the
schistosome-related pathology suffered by the mice is closely mirrored
in human (and other vertebrate) patients. Five weeks ago, the mice you
see before you were exposed to water with active <em>Schistosoma
mansoni</em> cercariae. They were then shipped to UW, and we held them
for six weeks, while their S. mansoni parasites developed. Some of these
mice may be uninfected, but most will carry extremely heavy
infections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Begin by performing an external examination of your mouse. Do you
see anything unusual or notable? Measure your mouse’s length, from snout
to rear and from snout to tail tip.</li>
<li>Lay your mouse on its back and begin by making an incision from the
anus to the throat using the small scissors. Keep your incision shallow
to avoid damaging internal organs.</li>
<li>Pin out the flaps of skin on either side of the mouse, exposing the
body cavity.</li>
<li>Observe and draw the internal organs. Note anything unusual.</li>
<li>Compare the liver and intestines of the infected mouse to pictures
of healthy mice (see below). What pathology do you observe in the
infected mouse? The white spots on the liver of the infected animal are
granulomas. Encapsulation of schistosome eggs by the host causes
granulomas. What is the consequence to the host? How did the eggs get
into the liver? * Where should they be?</li>
<li>Now use your dissecting scope to explore the internal organs more
closely. The adult worms are visible in the portal veins of your
mouse.</li>
<li>Once you have finished drawing your host, remove its parasites.
Tease apart the organs to access the portal veins. * * * Breach the
portal vein to pull out the worm, or pull out the entire vein.</li>
<li>Place adult worms into Ringers’ solution. Can you differentiate
between the male and female worms? Describe any movement or behavior
that you see in these living specimens. Draw both the adults and
eggs.</li>
<li>Many of these worms will have ripe eggs. Any student who is able to
obtain a miracidium will be awarded +3 points on the next exam. Hint:
what kind of fluid will trigger hatching in a schistosome egg?</li>
<li>The prominent lateral spine is diagnostic for this species. The eggs
of Schistosoma japonicum have a less prominent spine and those of
haematobium are terminal. How are spined eggs an adaptation for these
worms? Most helminth parasite infections in humans are diagnosed by the
presence of characteristic eggs in the feces or urine. You should be
able to identify schistosome eggs on the exam.</li>
