<h1>Welcome to Parasite Ecology</h1>
<p><strong>You’re in for a wild ride!</strong> Parasites are all around
you, every day, hidden and unnoticed but ubiquitous. And yet it is
entirely possible (even likely!) that you’ve never before encountered
parasites in your biology education. This makes for an explosive
combination: you’re about to learn about a secret world hidden under
everything that is familiar to you, a world of organisms with
adaptations so weird, so grotesque, so elaborate, that their existence
defies belief. But I assure you - parasites are very, very real.</p>
<p>Never hesitate to reach out if you have questions, concerns, or just
want to chat. You can reach me at <a

<h1>Classroom conduct</h1>
<p>I am dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive learning
environment for all students, regardless of their background, identity,
physical appearance, or manner of communication. Any form of language or
behavior used to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort will not be
tolerated. This applies to all course participants (instructor,
students, guests). In order to foster a positive and professional
learning environment, I ask the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Please let me know what name and pronouns I should use when I
address you</p></li>
<li><p>Please let me know if <em>anyone</em> in class says something
that makes you feel uncomfortable<sup>[<a
href="#endnotes">1</a>]</sup></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, I encourage the following kinds of behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use welcoming and inclusive language</p></li>
<li><p>Show courtesy and respect towards others</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge different viewpoints and experiences</p></li>
<li><p>Gracefully accept constructive criticism</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although I strive to create and use inclusive materials in this
course, there may be overt or covert biases in the course material due
to the lens with which it was written. Your suggestions about how to
improve the value of diversity in this course are encouraged and
appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong>: If you believe you have been a victim

<div id="access-accommodations" class="section level1">
<h1>Access &amp; accommodations</h1>
<p>All students deserve access to the full range of learning
experiences, and the University of Washington is committed to creating
inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal
and state laws. If you feel like your performance in class is being
impacted by your experiences outside of class, please talk with me.</p>
<div id="disabilities" class="section level3">
<h3>Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you have already established accommodations with Disability
Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved
accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your
needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through
DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that
requires accommodations (<em>e.g.</em>, mental health, learning, vision,
hearing, physical impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at
206-543-8924 or via <a href="mailto:uwdrs@uw.edu">email</a> or their <a
href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/">website</a>. DRS offers
resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with
disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable
accommodations are established through an interactive process between
you, your instructor(s) and DRS.</p>
</div>
<div id="religious-observances" class="section level3">
<h3>Religious observances</h3>
<p>Students who expect to miss class or assignments as a consequence of
their religious observance will be provided with a reasonable
accommodation to fulfill their academic responsibilities. Absence from
class for religious reasons does not relieve students from
responsibility for the course work required during the period of
absence. It is the responsibility of the student to provide the
instructor with advance notice of the dates of religious holidays on
which they will be absent. Students who are absent will be offered an
opportunity to make up the work, without penalty, within a reasonable
time, as long as the student has made prior arrangements.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="excused-absence" class="section level1">
<h1>Excused absence</h1>
<p>Students are expected to attend class and to participate in all
graded activities. A student who is anticipating being absent from class
due to a Religious Accommodation activity needs to complete the
Religious Accommodations request process by the second Friday of the
quarter. Students who anticipate missing class due to attendance at
academic conferences or field trips, or participation in
university-sponsored activities should provide a written notice to the
instructor ahead of the absence. The instructor will determine if the
graded activity can be rescheduled or if there is equivalent work that
can be done as an equivalent, as determined by the instructor.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="technology" class="section level1">
<h1>Technology</h1>
<p>This course will revolve around hands-on exercises that demonstrate
the topics of interest. Therefore, students are strongly recommended to
bring their own laptop to class, although students are certainly free to
work with one another. <strong>For students without access to a personal
laptop</strong>: it is possible to check out UW laptops for an entire
quarter (see the <a
href="https://education.uw.edu/admissions/office-of-student-services">Student
Services office</a> for details).</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="teaching-methodology" class="section level1">
<h1>Teaching methodology</h1>
<p>This course will introduce new material primarily through prepared
slides and hands-on demonstrations. Students will be expected to work
both individually and collaboratively; course content and evaluation
will emphasize the communication of ideas and the ability to think
critically more so than a specific pathway or method. Other areas of
this website provide an overview of the topics to be covered, including
links to weekly reading assignments, lecture materials, and homework
assignments.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="communication" class="section level1">
<h1>Communication</h1>
<p>This course will involve a <em>lot</em> of communication between and
among students and the instructor. Short questions should be addressed
to me via email; I will try my best to respond to your message within 24
hours. Detailed questions should be addressed to me in person–either
after class or during a scheduled meeting.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="evaluation" class="section level1">
<h1>Evaluation</h1>
<p>Students will be evaluated on their knowledge of course content and
their ability to communicate their understanding of the material via
individual homework assignments. There will be 7 homework assignments,
each with varying weight on your final grade. Please note, <strong>all
assignments must be turned in to achieve a passing grade</strong>.</p>
<p>Homework will be assigned each Monday and will be due by 1:30 PM the
following Monday, with the exception of the final assignment. Late
homework will not be accepted. The instructor will evaluate and return
student homework assignments within one week of their due date.
<strong>If for some reason you cannot meet the homework deadline,
contact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss other
options</strong>. Please see the <a href="homework.html">Homework</a>
page for more details.</p>
<div id="participation" class="section level3">
<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>This course will require students to engage with the instructor and
one another in small groups. I expect all students to contribute to our
discussions and I will call on students in class in order to ensure that
we hear from everyone.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level1">
<h1>Academic integrity</h1>
<p>Faculty and students at the University of Washington are expected to
maintain the highest standards of academic conduct, professional
honesty, and personal integrity. Plagiarism, cheating, and other
academic misconduct are serious violations of the <a
href="https://www.washington.edu/cssc/for-students/academic-misconduct/">Student
Conduct Code</a>. I have no reason to believe that anyone will violate
the Student Conduct Code, but <em>I will have no choice</em> but to
refer any suspected violation(s) to the College of the Environment for a
Student Conduct Process hearing. Students who have been guilty of a
violation will receive zero points for the assignment in question.</p>

<h1>Food Pantry</h1>
<p>No student should ever have to choose between buying food or
textbooks. The UW Food Pantry helps mitigate the social and academic
effects of campus food insecurity. They aim to lessen the financial
burden of purchasing food by providing students access to shelf-stable
groceries, seasonal fresh produce, and hygiene products at <strong>no
cost</strong>. Students can expect to receive 4 to 5 days’ worth of
supplemental food support when they visit the Pantry, located on the
north side of Poplar Hall at the corner of NE 41<sup>st</sup> St and
Brooklyn Ave NE. Visit the <a href="https://uw.edu/anyhungryhusky">Any
Hungry Husky website</a> for additional information, including operating
hours and additional food support resources.</p>

student uncomfortable, the student should feel free to contact the
Director of the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences.</p>
