<p><strong>You’re in for a wild ride!</strong> Parasites are all around
you, every day, hidden and unnoticed but ubiquitous. And yet it is
entirely possible (even likely!) that you’ve never before encountered
parasites in your biology education. This makes for an explosive
combination: you’re about to learn about a secret world hidden under
everything that is familiar to you, a world of organisms with
adaptations so weird, so grotesque, so elaborate, that their existence
defies belief. But I assure you - parasites are very, very real.</p>

<h1>Course details</h1>
<p><strong>This website</strong> will be your resource for all course
content, but <strong>we will use Canvas for announcements, submitting
assignments and keeping track of grades.</strong></p>
<p>This class is conducted in-person. Students are expected to
participate in class to fully benefit from course activities and meet
the course’s learning objectives. Students should only register for this
class if they are able to attend in-person.</p>
<p>Science education research has demonstrated that students who take an
active role in their learning learn more and retain that knowledge
longer; therefore, it is in your best interest to prepare for and
actively participate in class meetings – including small group
activities and whole-class discussions. <strong>One thing that may help
you participate in class is bringing questions you have written out
ahead of time.</strong> I will sometimes use a random name generator to
call on students at random.</p>

below).</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="course-description" class="section level1">
<h1>Course description</h1>
<p>Parasites are ubiquitous: no ecosystem exists without them, and among
all of Earth’s species, parasites outnumber non-parasites. But because
they are usually small and hidden within their hosts, parasites can be
easy to overlook. This course will introduce students to these rarely
studied creatures, which span the entire tree of life, occupy all of
Earth’s habitats, and influence many ecological processes.</p>
<p>Our material will survey all metazoan parasites, most protozoa, and
some bacteria and viruses, addressing their distribution, ecology, and
physiological effects on human and wildlife hosts. Because this is an
ecology course, we will survey parasite diversity in light of
evolutionary diversification. Phylogenetic relationships within and
among groups will provide the framework for the course.</p>
<p>Within this phylogenetic framework, the bulk of our time will be
spent exploring general disease ecology theory through relatable case
studies of individual taxa. We will explore fundamental principles of
parasite populations and communities. We will investigate the effects of
parasites on host populations (e.g., host population regulation),
communities (e.g., parasite-mediated competition), and ecosystems (e.g.,
nutrient availability). We will strive to put parasites into a food-web
context, assessing the impacts of parasites on food webs (e.g.,
connectance, nestedness, energy flow, biomass, food chain length) and of
food webs on parasites (e.g., dilution effect hypothesis,
biodiversity-begets-biodiversity hypothesis). Finally, we will use our
accumulated knowledge to make predictions for how disease transmission
might respond to human impacts like biodiversity loss, climate change,
and urbanization and will evaluate the interventions available for
wildlife and human disease control (e.g., vaccination, culling,
environmental modification, biological control).</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="learning-goals" class="section level1">
<h1>Learning goals</h1>
<p>By the end of the quarter, I expect you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>recognize each of the major groups of parasites and describe their
basic life cycles</li>
<li>analyze and critically evaluate graphical representations of
data</li>
<li>analyze and interpret parasitological data</li>
<li>interpret, evaluate, and synthesize primary literature in parasite
ecology (accomplished via writing assignment and presentation)</li>
<li>critique your colleagues’ ideas respectfully yet substantively</li>
<li>communicate ideas effectively, in writing and speech</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div id="grading-scale" class="section level1">
<h1>Grading scale</h1>
<p>Note that there will be no curve and no extra credit assignments.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="incompletes" class="section level1">
<h1>Incompletes</h1>
<p>From UW’s Faculty Resource on Grading: “An Incomplete is given only
when the student has been in attendance and has done satisfactory work
until within two weeks of the end of the quarter and has furnished proof
satisfactory to the instructor that the work cannot be completed because
of illness or other circumstances beyond the student’s control… To
obtain credit for the course, an undergraduate student must convert an
Incomplete into a passing grade no later than the last day of the next
quarter… An Incomplete grade not made up by the end of the next quarter
is converted to the grade of 0.0 by the Office of the University
Registrar… An Incomplete grade does not count for registered hours nor
in computation of grade-point averages.”</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level1">
<h1>Academic integrity</h1>
<p>Students at the University of Washington are expected to maintain the
highest standards of academic conduct, professional honesty, and
personal integrity. Plagiarism, cheating, and other misconduct are
serious violations of the University of Washington Student Conduct Code
(WAC 478-120). I expect you to know and follow the university’s policies
on cheating and plagiarism. Any suspected cases of academic misconduct
will be handled according to University of Washington regulations. For
more information, see the University of Washington Community Standards
and Student Conduct website.</p>
<p>I don’t expect anyone in this class to engage in academic misconduct
– parasite ecology is a window into a new and exciting world, and
cheating robs the cheater of the opportunity to explore and know that
world. But just in case, I will state up front my policy for addressing
academic misconduct: if you are caught cheating, falsifying data,
plagiarizing, collaborating on assignments in a manner that is
prohibited, or committing any other kind of academic misconduct as
defined in the Student Conduct Code, you will receive an automatic zero
on the assignment and the case will be referred to the College of the
Environment for a Student Conduct Process hearing. If you are caught
twice, you will receive a zero in the course and the case will be
referred for an additional hearing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="ai-based-tools" class="section level2">
<h2>AI-based tools</h2>
<p>Using an AI-based tool like ChatGPT on writing assignments like the
FISH 406 term paper removes your opportunity to get to know the
parasites, hurting you in a number of ways.</p>
<p>You might think, “I’m never gonna be a parasite ecologist, so what
does it matter whether I do these assignments or let an AI do them for
me?” Maybe you won’t become a parasite ecologist. But <em>the skills
that our assignments will teach you (writing, critical thinking,
hypothesis development, creative problem-solving) are valuable across a
range of professions</em>. If you let AI do assignments for you, you’re
missing a great opportunity to build those skills and make yourself
marketable across a variety of fields.</p>
<p>Not only that, but <em>AI is bad at a lot of stuff, and creativity is
a particular weakness</em>. AI just vomits out what it has already seen
in its training dataset. The FISH 406 term project asks you to think
creatively. Your human brain can generate much better ideas than a robot
brain.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for avoiding the temptation to use AI-based
tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are you struggling? Good, that means you’re
learning!</strong> You might think AI is a way to avoid struggle, but if
you do that you are robbing yourself of the opportunity to learn. Lean
on your classmates, your TAs, and on me and together we will make sure
that you are able to use your own human brain to create something
remarkable.</li>
<li><strong>How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.</strong>
Your term project is scaffolded. We have designed it so that you are
forced to tackle it only in bite-sized chunks and with tons of support
from your colleagues and instructors. If you submit all of the
assignments along the way, you should never have more than a few bites
of elephant to eat at a time.</li>
</ul>
<p>My policy is: <strong>if I discover that you have turned in
AI-generated work, I will give a grade of 0% for that
assignment</strong>. But that shouldn’t be your primary deterrent.
Remember that using AI will leave you with fewer skills than you
otherwise might have. Don’t let AI take away your opportunity to learn
and grow!</p>
