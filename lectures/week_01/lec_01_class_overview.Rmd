## Communication is central to science

> - Data are great, but if insights from data are not shared, they do not advance our understanding of nature (which is the point of science).

> - Insights from data are shaped and shared via communication - papers, yes, but also proposals, talks, peer reviews, websites, socials.

> - This course is designed to sharpen your communication skills, especially your writing skills.


## Writing is hard...

Very few writers are geniuses - most find it difficult and time-consuming. Even some "geniuses" struggle. Here's what Steven King has to say about it:

"Stories are relics, part of an undiscovered, pre-existing world. The writer’s job is to use the tools in his or her toolbox to get as much of each one out of the ground intact as possible."

When you're writing, imagine yourself on an archaeological dig. Just because progress is incremental and back-breaking doesn't mean you are doing it wrong.


## ...but the rewards for writing well are great.

* Influential papers that change the world's understanding of nature

> - Memorable talks that change your colleagues' minds

> - Successful proposals that allow you to do the science you want to do

> - Students whose trajectories you will bend

> - Regular folks whose understanding of nature is enriched by their interaction with you

> - Connection in an isolating age


## So what's the secret for effective communication?

* Writing (especially scientific writing) is a craft, not an art

> - Anyone can get better at writing with practice and deliberate attention

> - Half the battle is self-management - developing good writing behavior


## Reading & writing go hand-in-hand

* When reading, make notes about things you (dis)like

> - If you like a paper, why do you feel that way?

> - What wording, structure, and graphics do you find most effective?

> - If you don't like a paper, or it's hard to understand, what elements are you struggling with?


## Writing behavior

Writing typically goes slowly for 3 reasons:

1. Lots of time spent writing, editing, rephrasing, reorganizing

2. Distractions

4. You're spinning your wheels because you haven't set the stage for success


## Sound familiar?

Heard (2016, p22) writes

"For instance, after opening the blank document that was to become [Chapter 4], but before writing anything past the title, I checked my email four times, read news articles in the New York Times and the Toronto Globe and Mail, went to the greenhouse to weed (unnecessarily) goldenrods growing for an experiment, read the latest postings on a baseball blog, a computer-security blog, and two economics blogs, and thought hard about whether is was close enough to noon to heat up my lunch. (Sadly it wasn't.)"


## Encouraging self-awareness

**Reminders**

> - Put a sticky note on your monitor that asks, "*How* are you writing?"

> - Are you actually writing or doing something else?


## Encouraging self-awareness

**Writing log**

> - Choose a 2+ hour block for writing

> - Set an alarm for every 6-10 minutes and note what you've been doing


## Encouraging self-awareness

**Cooperation**

> - Discuss behaviors with a friend or colleague

> - Send copies of daily accomplishments or exchange writing logs


## Encouraging self-awareness

**Quieting your inner critic**

> - Do you hear a little voice criticizing you or your work? That's your inner critic.

> - He's trying to protect you. He doesn't realize that he's not helping.

> - If he's being particularly loud, you can write down what he says to you. Getting it out in the open can help reveal it as false or you can discuss with a friend.

> - Gently thank your critic for trying to protect you; tell him you're safe and he isn't needed.


## Encouraging self-awareness

**Setting the stage for success**

> - Block out writing time on your calendar, just as you would for a meeting, and honor it the way you would honor a meeting.

> - At least 30 minutes for writing, every work day. No more than 3-4 hours of writing per day.

> - Writing every day minimizes your start-up time. You'd be surprised how much you can get done in small, consistent increments.

> - When does your brain work best? Schedule your writing time for that part of the day.


## Behavioral challenges

**Avoidance**

> - Procrastinators ("I need a snack")

> - Intentional non-starters ("I'll save this for tomorrow")


## Behavioral challenges

**Distraction**

> - Consider your environment and time of day

> - What else is going on in your life?


## Behavioral challenges

**Feeling stuck ("writer's block")** 

> - Lower your standards

> - Divide and conquer

> - Change your environment or take a break

> - Talk it out

> - Freewrite


## Behavioral challenges

**Perfectionism**

> - Try to get *something* on paper & edit it later

> - This strategy is sometimes called "barf and buff" or "write drunk, edit sober."


## Behavioral challenges

**Fear of criticism**

> - Red ink can be triggering

> - Accept constructive criticism and make it work for you

## Finding papers of interest?

* Word of mouth

* Journal table of contents

* Online searches


## Web of Science (WOS)

* WOS is a powerful and popular option

* Find it online [here](https://guides.lib.uw.edu/az.php)


## Google Scholar

* Google Scholar is another option

* Find it online [here](https://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en)
